# CC-RB-LF-SCH-DASHBOARD

The goal of CC-RB-LF-SCH-DASHBOARD repository is to run the data
pipeline necessary to prepare the data for the CC-RB-LF-SCH Dashboard.

## Quick Start

The pipeline is set up as `{targets}` workflow. Therefore, if you donâ€™t
already have it installed you must run `install.packages("targets")`.

- To activate the workflow you can simply run `targets::tar_make()`
  which will execute any necessary components of the pipeline and store
  the data objects inside the `targets/objects` directory
- You can view and adjust the targets pipeline inside of the
  `_targets.R` file. This file is set up to read like a book chapters so
  you can clearly view each steps and read what about what is happening.
- you can familiarize yourself with the pipeline by reading through the
  `_targets.R` file and clicking on the functions for more details. For
  even more explanation of the functions check out the `data_cleaning_*`
  notebooks inside of the `documentation` folder.

## Data Sources

list all data sources here in bullet format. I think best to include
file name and short description then you can share the path to each file
in an email/DM. We will link to all data sources with `keys` and **never
put data into the repo**

1.  *fill here*
2.  *etc.*

## Structure

The repository is based around an R project (`.rproj`). The structure
will closely follow R package design protocol, but will not be built
into a package at this stage. We avoid creating a `package-project` as
we will want to minimize complications when/if we deploy a `{targets}`
workflow.

- **R** - contains pure functions
- **scripts** - scripts/exploratory work done in `.R` files
- **rmds** - work done in `.Rmd` files.
- **note** - it might make sense to `usethis::use_vignette()` rather
  than `rmds`as typical for package development. We can assess this
  later on.
- **tests** - automatically created by `usethis::use_testthat()` for
  storing tests.
